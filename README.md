#Payroll Helper

##Motivation
  Payroll administrators often find themselves lost in spreadsheets early in the week. If they are lucky, they wont be stuck there through to the end of the week, but for larger companies, the payroll does end up a long, tedious process that lasts most of the week, with dedicated teams of people working on sorting out all of the different forms of payment that need to be made to employees.
  I work in the hospitality industry, and I have seen some pretty complex excel workbooks to handle weekly payroll. In a large restaurant chain, with a centralized, in-house HR department and payroll team, keeping track of hundreds of hourly employees, tipped employees, office staff, salaried managers, and on is a complicated endeavor.
  This little app aims to chip away at some of the more repetitive, but time consuming aspects of the payroll process. It has helped my company's payroll team save dozens of hours per week and have payroll ready earlier in the week.
